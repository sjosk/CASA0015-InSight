# üëÄ Introduction  
The inspiration for this indoor navigation application arose from a classroom session where videos were shown about how blind and visually impaired individuals use smartphones. This sparked a reflection on the limitations of GPS navigation within indoor environments, particularly due to the interference caused by buildings. Observations at the UCL One Pool Street building revealed that the accessibility features are in need of improvement; there is a notable absence of tactile paving and sufficient guidance systems.   
InSight aims to enhance the navigational experience for visually impaired individuals by leveraging the capabilities of beacons and smartphone features, such as voice feedback and vibration, to provide a more seamless and accessible learning environment.  

# ‚≠êÔ∏èFeatures  
The app architecture diagram visually represents the structure of a Flutter mobile application designed for indoor navigation, floor transition, and emergency responses. The main entry point, the Home Page, offers users three primary functionalities: Indoor Navigation, Floor Transition, and Emergency.  

1. **Indoor Navigation Page**: This page integrates voice synthesis (TTS) to provide spoken directions, beacon detection to locate users within a building, and speech recognition to allow users to interact with the app via voice commands. It helps users navigate internally, with detailed pathways from one point to another.

2. **Floor Transition Page**: Utilizing beacon technology, this page aids users in navigating to crucial points like elevators or stairs in multi-floor buildings, enhancing the ease of moving through different building levels.

3. **Emergency Page**: Designed for urgent situations, it provides expedited routes to the main entrance and includes functionality to make emergency calls, ensuring quick evacuation or immediate contact with emergency services.

# üåª Accessible Design for User Experience and Interface  

### üé® Color Universal Design
According to the Color Universal Design guidelines, the choice of colors was given special consideration. Considering that some groups have difficulty distinguishing colors, high-contrast options were selected, and commonly confused colours were avoided. Additionally, icons of distinct shapes were incorporated to provide users with an alternative recognition method.

### üì≤ Feedback and Guidance  
The app incorporates external libraries such as Flutter Beacon for beacon interaction, Flutter TTS for text-to-speech functionality, Speech to Text for voice input, and Vibration for physical feedback, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
